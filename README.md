# Scripts for protein turnover estimation

1. **System requirements**

	The script has been tested and works on platforms where MATLAB is installed (version 2014b or more recent) with the Optimization and Statistics Toolbox (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, Massachusetts, United States; either on Windows, Linux or Mac).

2. **Installation guide**

	No installation of the script is necessary.
	All MATLAB scripts (*.m) need to be copied into a common folder that is searchable by MATLAB (add the folder to the MATLAB search path). Make sure the Statistics and Optimization toolboxes are installed. The following steps are best run from the graphical user interface “turnoverGUI.m”.

	Start the turnover script by typing “turnoverGUI” in the MATLAB command window without parameters (and without the quotation marks).

3. **Demo**

	A testing dataset for evaluation purposes of the MATLAB scripts is available in the main associated manuscript (Supplementary Table 2). Expected output is detailed in the main associated manuscript and run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer is in the order of one hour.

4. **Instructions for use**

	Instruction for use and detailed pseudocode is available in the main associated manuscript in the "Procedure" section in Module IV and Module V.
